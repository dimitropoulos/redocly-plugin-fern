/**
 * Reports request bodies on GET and HEAD operations.
 *
 * - GET: Fern's importer drops the request body, so the generated SDK never sends it.
 * - HEAD: Fern keeps the request body (JSON, multipart, form-urlencoded or binary content) and
 *   its validator then rejects the endpoint. Bodies with only other media types are dropped
 *   before validation and are not reported.
 *
 * Operations Fern does not import (`x-fern-ignore: true`, webhooks) are skipped.
