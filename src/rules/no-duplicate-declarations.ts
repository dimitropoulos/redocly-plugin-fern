/**
 * Reports names Fern would declare more than once in the same directory of the generated Fern
 * definition: type names (from `components.schemas` keys, `x-fern-type-name` on component and
 * inline schemas), request wrapper names (`x-fern-request-name` / `x-request-name`, the request
 * body schema's `x-fern-type-name`, or the name generated from the SDK method name or operationId)
 * and error names (one per 4xx/5xx status code).
 *
 * Most collisions make `fern check` fail. Two types with the same name in the same Fern definition
 * file do not: Fern keeps only one of them and silently drops the other, so references to the
 * dropped schema end up pointing at a different one. Both are reported as errors.
 *
 * Fern inlines a component used as a JSON request body into the request (and names the request
 * after it) only when no other operation or schema references the component. Operations with an
 * `x-fern-streaming` stream-condition become two endpoints whose requests are named separately.
 *
 * Collisions Fern resolves on its own are not reported: component keys equal to an error name are
 * renamed with a `Body` suffix, and generated request names that clash with a component schema get
 * a `Body` suffix. Duplicate operationIds are covered by Redocly's `operation-operationId-unique`.
 *
 * Options:
 * - `resolveSchemaCollisions` (boolean, default false): mirrors the `resolve-schema-collisions`
 *   setting in generators.yml, which makes Fern number repeated `x-fern-type-name` values.
